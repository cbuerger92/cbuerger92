## Welcome to my Github Profile ðŸ‘‹

My name is Christina. After completing two apprenticeships in design, I spent over 7 years working in various advertising agencies. I first focused on designing user-friendly websites and apps, honing my skills in digital design. Later, in a different agency, I transitioned into the social media space, where I advised clients on their social media strategies and managed their online presence. My responsibilities included concept development, executing design ideas, and overseeing product shoots from preparation to completion.

Now, I have decided to take on a new challenge and further my career by training as a software developer.
